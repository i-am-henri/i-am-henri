**Hello World**

My name is henri, I'm 15 years old student. I've dedicated my work to web applications, mostly made with nextjs or other react frameworks. In the last year, I also worked more on the design of apps & websites, for example in figma or framer. I love well designed interfaces, frameworks and libraries with top developer experience and wakeboarding!
